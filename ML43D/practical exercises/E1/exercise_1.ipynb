    "- You have to submit and pass all 3 exercises to get the 0.3 exam bonus\n",

    "- Name your submission as your matriculation number(s) separated by underscores, e.g. \"0123456_0123457.zip\"\n",
    "- To successfully complete an exercise, fill out the blanks in this jupyter notebook and all referenced files. Make sure all cells in this notebook run as expected. Then, submit everything, including files you generated during the exercise in a single zip file via the submission feature in Moodle\n",
