    "<div class=\"alert alert-danger\">\n",
    "    <strong>Note:</strong> This exercise is optional and can be done for a better understanding of batch normalization. Also, when using batch normalization with PyTorch, you should be paying attention to the number of dimensions in the input (see <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#batchnorm1d\">BatchNorm1d</a>, <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#batchnorm2d\">BatchNorm2d</a> etc.)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We already saw that batch normalization is a very useful technique for training deep fully-connected networks. Batch normalization can also be used for convolution networks, but we need to tweak it a bit; the modification will be called \"spatial batch normalization\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Since this part is strongly based on batch normalization, a good understanding of batch normalization in general is helpful. If you are not too familiar with the concept and implementation, take a look at the optional notebook `Optional-BatchNormalization&Dropout.ipynb` from exercise 08 first.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Extension from Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape $(N, D)$ and produces outputs of shape $(N, D)$, where we normalize across the mini-batch dimension $N$. For data coming from convolution layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape $(N, C, H, W)$ and produce outputs of shape $(N, C, H, W)$ where the $N$ dimension gives the mini-batch size and the $(H, W)$ dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the feature map was produced using convolutions, we apply the same filter to different locations of feature maps from last layer and to the whole batch of data to get a single feature channel. Then we expect the statistics of each feature channel to be relatively consistent both between different images and different locations within the same image. Therefore spatial batch normalization computes a mean and variance for each of the $C$ feature channels by computing statistics over both the mini-batch dimension $N$ and the spatial dimensions $H$ and $W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding of relationship and difference between batch normalization and spatial batch normalization, the picture taken from [CS231n Note](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/slides/2018/cs231n_2018_lecture07.pdf) gives us a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/SpatialBatchNorm.JPG' width=70% height=70%/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically they share the same computation rules, i.e. normalize over some dimensions and transform to new output based on $y = \\gamma (x - \\mu) / \\delta + \\beta$. But they operate in different dimensions, since images are stored in a higher dimension tensor."
