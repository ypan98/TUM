# In-class exercise 1: Help to improve the decryption efficiency

There is a new breach in time today! A member of The Timekeepers is trying to fix it, but she needs saved time to fill it. And she is in a hurry, in 10 minutes the breach will be irreversible. It's time for you to help. You need to efficiently finish a decryption task. The wasteful code is located in **sequential_implementation.cpp**. Do you think you're up to it? 

## Your tasks
1. Modify the code in **student_submission.cpp** file to improve the efficiency of the decryption.
2. Submit your code written in **student_submission.cpp** to [https://parprog.caps.in.tum.de/](https://parprog.caps.in.tum.de/).
3. Make sure you reach the speedup of 3.

Remember - you only have 10 minutes.

## Technical details
The files Utility.h and Makefile were already sent to the server. You can only modify student_submission.cpp (in the beginning identical to sequential_implementation.cpp). As soon as you have optimized your code, upload ONLY student_submission.cpp to the server and check if your code saved us time.

Good luck! 

## How to run the code

```bash
make
# run sequential implementation
./sequential_implementation
# run your solution
./student_submission
```
